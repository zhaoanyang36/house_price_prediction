We create some feature for our sales data. For example:

Distance to the *nearest* university/college,

Distance to the nearest park centroid,

Distance to City Hall,

Distance to the 5 nearest new construction permits from 2018.

Then we make a regression by random forest to predict the Price Change Percentage.
